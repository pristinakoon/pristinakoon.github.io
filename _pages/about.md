I am a first-year PhD student in the University of Pennsylvania's Department of Linguistics. I am affiliated with the Language Contact and Cognition Lab, XMorph Lab, and Cultural Evolution of Language Lab. My research interests are centered around language contact with an emphasis on contact-induced change of morphology, so I am lucky to be co-advised by Professors Marlyse Baptista and David Embick. I am specifically interested in morphological multifunctionality and innovation in creole and pidgin languages. My current work is focused most heavily on Betawi and diasporic Ambon Malay.

Outside of my work, I am an avid language learner! I speak French and Indonesian and took some Korean courses in college. Research experiences have also exposed me to Jejueo, Malay, and Cham. I am currently studying Filipino, Tagalog, and Dutch (with some dabbling in Irish).

## My Name ## 
Although I was named after the capital of Kosova/o, my parents adopted an Americanized pronunciation, so my first name is pronounced [prɪˈstinə] or pris-teen-ah. My surname/family name is represented by the Chinese character 官. You can listen to the variations of its pronunciation here, but the Hakka one is the most applicable to my family.
