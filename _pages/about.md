I am a [first-year PhD student](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/people/pristina-koon) in the [University of Pennsylvania's Department of Linguistics](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/). I am affiliated with the [Language Contact and Cognition Lab](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/language-contact-cognition-lab/), [XMorph Lab](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/embick-lab/), and [Cultural Evolution of Language Lab](https://www.drgarethroberts.com/cultural-evolution-of-language-lab.html). My research interests are centered around language contact with an emphasis on contact-induced change of morphology, so I am lucky to be co-advised by Professors [Marlyse Baptista](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/marlysebaptista/) and [David Embick](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/~embick/). I am specifically interested in morphological multifunctionality and innovation in creole and pidgin languages. My current work is focused most heavily on [Betawi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betawi_language) and diasporic [Ambon Malay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambonese_Malay).

I can be best reached at pristina[at]sas[dot]upenn[dot]edu, or you can use this [link](mailto:pristina@sas.upenn.edu).

## My Name ## 
Although I was named after the [capital of Kosova/o](https://www.britannica.com/place/Pristina), my parents adopted an Americanized pronunciation, so my first name is pronounced [prɪˈstinə] or pris-teen-ah. My surname/family name is represented by the Chinese character [官](https://zh.wiktionary.org/zh-hans/%E5%AE%98). You can listen to the variations of its pronunciation [here](https://forvo.com/search/%E5%AE%98/), but the [Hakka](https://forvo.com/search/%E5%AE%98/hak/) one is the most applicable to my family.
