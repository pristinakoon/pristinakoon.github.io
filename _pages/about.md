I am a [first-year PhD student](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/people/pristina-koon) in the [University of Pennsylvania's Department of Linguistics](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/). I am affiliated with the [Language Contact and Cognition Lab](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/language-contact-cognition-lab/), [XMorph Lab](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/embick-lab/), and [Cultural Evolution of Language Lab](https://www.drgarethroberts.com/cultural-evolution-of-language-lab.html). My research interests are centered around language contact with an emphasis on contact-induced change of morphology, so I am lucky to be co-advised by Professors [Marlyse Baptista](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/marlysebaptista/) and [David Embick](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/~embick/). I am specifically interested in morphological multifunctionality and innovation in creole and pidgin languages. My current work is focused most heavily on [Betawi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betawi_language) and diasporic [Ambon Malay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambonese_Malay).

I can be best reached at pristina[at]sas[dot]upenn[dot]edu, or you can use this [link](mailto:pristina@sas.upenn.edu). I live and [work](https://collaborativehistory.gse.upenn.edu/stories/original-people-and-their-land-lenape-pre-history-18th-century). on the Indigenous territory Lenapehoking of the [Lenape (Lenni-Lenape)](https://www.lenape-nation.org/). As a linguist, the role language policy and planning played in the systematic repression of Indigenous languages, histories, and cultures cannot be overlooked. To learn more about the Lenape language, specifically, please visit these sources: [Lenape Language Introduction](https://delawaretribe.org/blog/2013/06/26/language/), [The Lenape Talking Dictionary](https://www.talk-lenape.org/), and [References](https://samnoblemuseum.ou.edu/collections-and-research/native-american-languages/map-of-oklahoma-languages/unami-language/).

## My Name ## 
Although I was named after the [capital of Kosova/o](https://www.britannica.com/place/Pristina), my parents adopted an Americanized pronunciation, so my first name is pronounced [prɪˈstinə] or pris-teen-ah. My surname/family name is represented by the Chinese character [官](https://zh.wiktionary.org/zh-hans/%E5%AE%98). You can listen to the variations of its pronunciation [here](https://forvo.com/search/%E5%AE%98/), but the [Hakka](https://forvo.com/search/%E5%AE%98/hak/) one is the most applicable to my family.
