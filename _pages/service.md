A linguist's work is only made possible through the incredible resources provided by community partners and the time, effort, and relationships given graciously by speaker communities. On this page you will find some resources and community partners I rely on heavily, admire, and hope to contribute to through community-based scholarship. Please be sure to learn more about them!
