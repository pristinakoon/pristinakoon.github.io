A linguist's work is only made possible through the incredible resources provided by community partners and the time, effort, and relationships given graciously by speaker communities. On this page you will find some resources and community partners (alphabetical order) I rely on heavily, admire, or have worked with. Please be sure to learn more about them! 

## [Endangered Language Alliance](https://www.elalliance.org/) ##
The ELA focuses on preserving endangered languages in NYC's diverse language ecology. They engage in community-centered events and have worked with languages from all over the globe. 

## [Gapura Philly](https://www.gapuraphilly.org/) ## 
Gapura Philly is a non-profit focused on serving the Indonesian community in Philadelphia. 

## [Lembaga Kebudayaan Betawi](https://www.kebudayaanbetawi.com/) ##
The LKB is a great resource for learning more about Betawi langauge and culture. They have been integral to helping me with my projects on this Malay-lexified Creole. 

## [University of Michigan Language Resource Center](https://lsa.umich.edu/lrc) ##
I was very fortunate to work at UMich's LRC during my undergrad. I worked primarily on documenting archival sources on the history of language courses at UM and as an enrollment intern for Less Commonly Taught Languages (LCTLs). If you would like to learn more about the specific projects I worked on during my time at the LRC, please visit this [site](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/lrcshowcase/). 

## [WikiTongues](https://wikitongues.org/) ## 
WikiTongues maintains an impressive archive of endangered languages and strives towards their revitalization. (See their videos  on Ambon Malay [here](https://wikitongues.org/videos/nila_20150321_abs/)!)
