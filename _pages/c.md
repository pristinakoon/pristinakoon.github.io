## [Lembaga Kebudayaan Betawi](https://www.kebudayaanbetawi.com/) ##
The LKB is a great resource for learning more about Betawi langauge and culture. They have been integral to helping me with my projects on this Malay-lexified Creole. 

## [University of Michigan Language Resource Center](https://lsa.umich.edu/lrc) ##
I was very fortunate to work at UMich's LRC during my undergrad. I worked primarily on documenting archival sources on the history of language courses at UM and as an enrollment intern for Less Commonly Taught Languages (LCTLs). If you would like to learn more about the specific projects I worked on during my time at the LRC, please visit this [site](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/lrcshowcase/). 

## [WikiTongues](https://wikitongues.org/) ##
