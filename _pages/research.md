## Overview ## 
My interest in language contact was initially sparked by my fascination on how multiple languages coexist in time and space together. From there, reading on pronoun borrowing grew my desire to learn more about how contact induces language change and variation. I currently focus on how morphology and grammatical features can change when two or more languages interact. This has implications for bi- and multilingualism, creolistics, and language genesis and evolution. 

I work primarily within the Distributed Morphology and Language Ecology contexts. Inspired by [Baptista, Gelman, and Beck (2016)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1367006914552459?journalCode=ijba), my work is guided by ovearching questions regarding how and why humans choose specific morphological forms and functions when presented with multiple options and what this can tells us about the larger functions of morphology within human language and communicative needs.
