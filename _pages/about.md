I am a [PhD student](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/people/pristina-koon) in the [University of Pennsylvania's Department of Linguistics](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/). I am affiliated with the [Language Contact and Cognition Lab](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/language-contact-cognition-lab/) and the [XMorph Lab](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/embick-lab/). My research interests are centered around morphology in multilinguals' grammars and, more broadly, language contact situations. I am co-advised by [Marlyse Baptista](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/marlysebaptista/) and [David Embick](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/~embick/). 

I can be best reached at pristina[at]sas[dot]upenn[dot]edu, or you can use this [link](mailto:pristina@sas.upenn.edu).

## My Name ## 
Although I was named after the [capital of Kosova/o](https://www.britannica.com/place/Pristina), my parents adopted an Americanized pronunciation, so my first name is pronounced [prɪˈstinə] or pris-teen-ah. My surname/family name is represented by the Chinese character [官](https://zh.wiktionary.org/zh-hans/%E5%AE%98). You can listen to the variations of its pronunciation [here](https://forvo.com/search/%E5%AE%98/), but the [Hakka](https://forvo.com/search/%E5%AE%98/hak/) one is the most applicable to my family.
