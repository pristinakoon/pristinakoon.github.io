The Indonesia Diaspora Languages in Contact (IDLIC) Project is an ongoing fieldwork project meant to document and highlight the linguistic diversity of the Indonesia diaspora communities in Philadelphia and New York City. Specific emphasis is placed on the role of language contact within the diaspora and the experiences of speakers of an Indonesian Creole language. We are currently working with speakers of Manado but encourage you to reach out if you identify as a speaker of a [Malay-based Creole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malay_trade_and_creole_languages). 

If you are interested in becoming a participant, please email pristina@sas.upenn.edu.
